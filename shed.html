            <p>The forest canopy intersects with the roof far above you. It’s so thick it blocks out
                 the moonlight. The features of the building are hard to discern. Your eyes struggle
                  to adjust and eventually you see one small window adorned with crooked shutters and
                   a narrow wooden door that is slightly askew. Peering closer you see it is open just
                    a crack</p>
