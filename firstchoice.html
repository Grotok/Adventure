            <p>It took a while but you made your way through the trees to the distant house. You now stand before a massive wooden door
                 decorated with an eerie skull. There’s a window to either side of you and a balcony on the second floor to your left.
                  Another small window in the bottom right corner of the house is wide open but you doubt you could fit through it.
                   There’s a pathway that’s losing its battle with the forest leading toward the rear of the house.</p>
