            <p>Walking up to the house you can't see any lights on inside. You could have sworn that you saw lights from the 
                edge of the forest....how odd. You can see a door directly in front of you.
                To your right are 4 windows that are shuttered, with the exception of the last window that seems to be slightly ajar.
            There's a balcony above the door that you might be able to reach if you could find something to stand on. There are some
        basement windows but they look like they would be to small to fit through.  </p>
