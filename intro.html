            <p>It's raining so hard you can barely see the road in front of you. You pull to the side and stop to try and get a better view
                of your surroundings. Oh no. You notice your engine light is on and smoke is starting to rise from beneath the car hood.
                You quickly turn the ignition off and get ready to go out and have a look. As you open the hood, fire bursts forth and singes
                the tips of your eyebrows. You lurch back in panic and tumble into the ditch. BOOM! It seems luck was on your side, falling
                into the ditch probably saved your life, your entire car is engulfed in flames. The rain has let up just in time to let your car
                burn unchallenged. Lookng around you see the faint lights of a house off some distance through the trees. You decide the best
                course of action is to seek help at the house.
