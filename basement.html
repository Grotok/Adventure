            <p>One of the basement windows is wide open. It's small but you think you might be able to
                wriggle through. You stick your head inside and look around. You can't see much except
                cobwebs and dust. As you start working your arm through the window a loud creak alerts
                you to the presence of something nearby. You panic and start to pull back causing you
                to get jammed in the window frame. Looking up you see a lumpy shape easing toward you.
                Screaming you pull back harder, but it's no use, you're trapped. The lumpy shape grabs
                hold of you, the pain in your neck intensifies until your head is torn from your body.
